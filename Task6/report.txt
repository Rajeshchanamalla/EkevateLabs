Best practices learned:

	Minimum length: 12 characters
	Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
	Avoid dictionary words, names, or dates
	Use passphrases or random generators
	Do not reuse passwords across accounts

Researched common password attacks:

	Brute Force Attack – tries all possible combinations
	Dictionary Attack – uses predefined lists of common passwords
	Credential Stuffing – uses stolen credentials from other sites

Summarize how password complexity affects security:

	Password complexity directly increases security by making passwords harder for attackers to guess or crack.
	Longer passwords exponentially increase the number of possible combinations, making brute-force attacks much slower.
	Mixing uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols adds variety, which defeats simple dictionary attacks.
	Avoiding common words and patterns prevents attackers from using precompiled password lists.
	Random and unique passwords reduce the risk from credential stuffing attacks, where leaked passwords are reused.

## commands used and their explaination:

sed -n '1,/^$/p' suspicious_eml_sample.eml > headers.txt
# Extracts everything from line 1 to the first empty line (email headers) and saves it to headers.txt.
# Email headers contain sender details, routing information, and authentication results useful for detecting spoofing.

grep -i 'Authentication-Results\|DKIM-Signature\|Received-SPF' suspicious_eml_sample.eml -n
# Searches the email for SPF, DKIM, and DMARC authentication results.
# The -i flag makes the search case-insensitive, and -n shows the line number of each match.
# Failures in these fields often indicate email spoofing.

grep -Eo '(http|https)://[^ >"]+' suspicious_eml_sample.eml | sort -u > urls_found.txt
# Finds all URLs in the email body that start with http or https.
# Uses a regular expression to match URLs, removes duplicates with sort -u, and saves them to urls_found.txt.

cat urls_found.txt
# Displays the unique URLs found in the email without opening them.
# Useful for manually inspecting suspicious links.

grep -iE 'filename=|name=' suspicious_eml_sample.eml
# Searches for attachment filenames in the email MIME headers.
# This can reveal if malicious files are attached (e.g., .zip, .exe, .doc with macros).

ripmime -i suspicious_eml_sample.eml -d attachments/
# Extracts attachments from the email into the 'attachments' folder.
# Allows safe inspection of file types without actually opening potentially harmful files.
